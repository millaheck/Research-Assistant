  >> RESEARCH ASSISTANT
        
        This project consists of a website whose objective is to assist in the development of research where the user registers, 
  enter the information about his research and he obtains personalized results that give an overview of the research, 
  contributing with clarity and organization to develop the tasks necessary to construct a research.

	Personalized results are: a brief summary of the research, an overview of the methodology, and a timetable. 

	The website basically consists of Home, About, Introduction, Support, Sign in, Sign up, Questionnaire and Results pages. 

	When entering the website, the user finds a home page welcoming the Research Assistant, on this page he finds some comments 
  about it and he sees the "Start" button. When he clicks on it, if he is already logged in he will be redirected to the Introduction page.

	On the introduction page there is information about the terminology used in the questionnaire to clarify and prepare the user for 
  answer the questionnaire. At the end of this page the user will find the "Answer questionnaire" button which will redirect him to the questionnaire 
  page where the user can respond and after clicking "Submit" he is redirected to the results page. There he can see personalized results 
  prepared for him.

	Once the user is logged in the "Sign in" button is replaced by a "Logout" button. If the user decides to take a look at the About 
 page, he will find a "Start" button, clicking on it will take them to the Sign in page if he is not logged in, and if he is, he will be 
 taken to the Introduction page.
 
	If the user wants to send a message to the website's support, he can do so on the Support page. The message is sent and stored in 
 the website's database, along with the user's name, email, and timestamp. The answers given in the questionnaire are also stored in the 
 website's database, in addition to the registered users and the analysis of the results.
