RESEARCH ASSISTANT                   
        >> This project consists of a website whose objective is to assist in the development of research where the user registers, enters the information about his research 
and obtains personalized results that give an overview of the research, contributing with clarity and organization to develop the tasks necessary to construct research.           
	>> Personalized results are: a brief summary of the research, an overview of the methodology, and a timetable.               
	>> The website basically consists of Home, About, Introduction, Support, Sign in, Sign up, Questionnaire, and Results pages.                                                                                                                                                                       
	>> When entering the website, the user finds a home page welcoming the Research Assistant, on this page, he finds some comments about it and he sees the "Start"
 button. When he clicks on it, if he is already logged in he will be redirected to the Introduction page.                  
	>> On the introduction page, there is information about the terminology used in the questionnaire to clarify and prepare the user to answer the questionnaire. At the
 end of this page, the user will find the "Answer questionnaire" button which will redirect him to the questionnaire page where the user can respond, and after clicking
 "Submit" he is redirected to the results page. There he can see personalized results prepared for him.                        
	>> Once the user is logged in the "Sign in" button is replaced by a "Logout" button. If the user decides to take a look at the About page, he will find a
 "Start" button, clicking on it will take them to the Sign-in page if he is not logged in, and if he is, he will be taken to the Introduction page.                    
	>> If the user wants to send a message to the website's support, he can do so on the Support page. The message is sent and stored in the website's database, along 
 with the user's name, email, and timestamp. The answers given in the questionnaire are also stored in the website's database, in addition to the registered users
 and the analysis of the results.                                      
  	>> To develop this work, HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages ​​were used. In addition,  Node.js, Firebase, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) - through 
   Google's CloudNatural Language API - which enables computers to process and analyze human language, which is a current trend in IT.                           
  	>> Because NLP is something new and challenging, naturally initial applications of this to a project will not bring such impressive results, which does not mean that
   it is not interesting to take it as a challenge, try to venture into this universe and discover the results that can come from it.                       
  	>> This assignment obviously requires improvements, however, because it is an academic assignment, - where in addition to it there are other
 academic assignments, classes, work, you don't have a team like in a company, nor the ideal time for development and don't have enough experience - the main objective is 
 the learning, the result is satisfactory, because there was effort, many trials and errors that generated, in addition to some headaches, also successes, and a lot of 
 knowledge.
